Row Major Representation is a method of representing multi dimension array in sequential memory.
In row-major representation, the elements of Matrix  are stored row-wise,
i.e., elements of 1st row, 2nd row, 3rd  row, and so on till mth row.
```

##### Column Major Representation:
```
Column Major Representation is a method of representing multi dimension array in sequential memory.
